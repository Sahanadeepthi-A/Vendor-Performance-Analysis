# Vendor-Performance-Analysis
End-to-end analytics project on supplier efficiency and performance optimization
Tools: SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), Power BI


## Project Overview
This project analyzes vendor performance using Python scripts and relevant datasets.  
It demonstrates data ingestion, processing, and summary analysis for better decision-making in vendor management.

* Analyzed over 10K vendor records to identify pricing inefficiencies, profit variations, and inventory turnover trends, enhancing data-driven decision-making for vendor management.

* Developed end-to-end data pipeline integrating SQL, Python, and Power BI, performing data cleaning, EDA, correlation analysis, and building interactive dashboards to visualize KPIs such as profit margin, stock turnover, and unsold capital.

* Delivered actionable insights that revealed $2.71 M unsold inventory capital and vendor dependency risks, leading to recommendations on diversification, bulk purchasing, and pricing optimization.


The datasets are stored in Google Drive.
